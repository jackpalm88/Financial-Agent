"""
Financial Agent - Tool-Augmented Multi-Modal Trading System

A production-ready AI agent that combines market data (price, volume, news, indicators)
with tool-augmented reasoning to generate validated MT5 trading signals.

Architecture:
    Input Fusion â†’ Stateful Memory â†’ Tool Stack â†’ Prompt Engine â†’ MT5 Bridge

Components:
    - bridge: MT5 execution with adapter pattern (âœ… Complete)
    - tools: Composable function toolkit (ðŸš§ In Progress)
    - fusion: Multi-modal input processing (ðŸ“‹ Planned)
    - memory: Pattern learning & feedback (ðŸ“‹ Planned)
    - orchestration: Context-aware prompts (ðŸ“‹ Planned)
    - common: Shared utilities

Example:
    >>> from financial_agent.bridge import MT5ExecutionBridge, MockAdapter
    >>> 
    >>> # Test without MT5
    >>> adapter = MockAdapter(success_rate=0.95)
    >>> await adapter.connect()
    >>> bridge = MT5ExecutionBridge(adapter=adapter)
    >>> 
    >>> # Execute signal
    >>> result = await bridge.execute_order(signal_id, signal)
